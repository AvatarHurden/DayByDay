# DayByDay
A journaling program.

It is made to greatly interact with DayOne, by Zendesk, although it lacks many of its functionalities. It supports tagging, starring, image insertion and date changing.

It also has support for markdown and high level search, with a simple natural language parsing for dates and intervals.
